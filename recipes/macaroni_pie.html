    <h3>Description of Recipe</h3>
    <p>Back in full swing for 2020, between being busy with work behind the scenes on the channel and being under the weather it took me a little longer than anticipated to drop my first video but I am here and I am doing Macaroni  Pie, a Trini Sunday Lunch classic. Now truth be told I am no longer a fan of macaroni  pie. When I was growing up, every Sunday I used to eat food from my mother and then go across by my grandmother and eat food again and every Sunday they will both make macaroni pie. So you could imagine how much pie I ate in my life. If I never see another macaroni pie in my life I will not feel like I missing anything. So while I dont make pie often and this is the first pie I am having in over 2 years, this is a recipe I developed a long time ago, choosing the right blend of ingredients to make a delicious  pie that does not require anything fancy.</p>
